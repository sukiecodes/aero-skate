          <h1>Why the Respiratory System?</h1>
          <p>
          Ice skating, a popular Olympic sport, has long captured the hearts of millions around the world. 
          Ice skaters perform complex routines with grace and precision, making it one of the most eagerly 
          watched sports during the games. Yet, behind the scenes, ice skaters face a host of challenges that 
          are seldom discussed in the public eye.
          </p>

          <p>
          In particular, the extremely cold environments necessary for ice skating can have significant health 
          implications. Many people experience discomfort when exposed to icy conditions, such as difficulty 
          breathing and increased vulnerability to colds. Imagine the strain an Olympic ice skater, who spends 
          countless hours training and competing in these harsh settings, would be putting their body through. 
          This overview delves into the less visible side of ice skating, exploring the physical and chemical 
          challenges these athletes endure.
          </p>

          <p>
          We will uncover the long-term effects of breathing in cold air, the impact of chemical substances 
          needed to keep indoor ice rinks icy, and the long-term effects of these conditions on the body. 
          Additionally, we'll explore the innovative strategies and adaptations that these ice skaters develop to
          cope with and overcome these environmental challenges. By understanding these aspects, we gain a deeper 
          appreciation of the resilience and dedication required to excel in the frosty arenas of Olympic ice skating.

          <h1> Asthma </h1>
          <p>
          Despite the irony, skate skaters have poor lungs. In fact, the majority of ice-sport Olympians have asthma. 
          Nearly 50% of cross-country skiers, 43% of short-track speed skaters, 21% of figure skaters, 17% of Nordic skaters, 
          and 15% of ice hockey players have exercise-induced asthma. According to Valdrin Xhemaj, a reporter for The 
          Conversation, a “huge increase in breathing results in large volumes of cold, dry air being drawn into the lungs. 
          This can cause the smooth muscle in the airway to narrow, reducing the athletes\’ ability to breathe normally.” 
          From what we learned in Biology 2, smooth muscles are found in the walls of bronchi and bronchioles. They help to 
          regulate the flow of air into the lungs, and during exercise, the smooth muscle relaxes to dilate the bronchi and 
          bronchioles. When they dilate, they allow for more air to pass through, but they also allow other particles to pass 
          through in and out.
          </p>

          <p>
          In addition to other particles passing through, the airway also becomes dry because, as we know, air dries out moist 
          places, like the lungs. When the airway becomes dehydrated, it “causes a release of inflammatory cytokines–messenger 
          molecules that cause the airway to become narrow and inflamed.” When inflammatory cytokines are released, it means a 
          distress signal is sent, and the body’s immune system will respond to fend off attackers like germs. When an excessive 
          immune response occurs, the cytokines can actually cause tissue damage. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Another reason for the increase in asthma could be “related to respiratory heat loss, which results in airway narrowing 
          through nerve stimulation. When the athlete stops exercising, the airway narrows even further by a dilation of blood vessels 
          as the airways warm up again.” Typically, when the body temperature increases, our respiratory system’s compliance improves, 
          and airway resistance decreases, which is a good thing. However, sudden temperature changes can also trigger lung symptoms. 
          Cold air is often dry air, which can irritate the airways. It can also cause respiratory infections, trigger bronchoconstriction 
          in people with asthma, and cause excessive secretions of airway mucus. Oftentimes, cold-induced asthma can cause symptoms including 
          chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, tight feeling in the chest, and wheezing. 
          </p>

          <h1>Exercise-Induced Bronchitis (EIB)</h1>
          <p>
          Exercised-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a condition in which physical activity triggers the narrowing of the airways in the 
          lungs, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. People with EIB are often sensitive 
          to low temperatures and dry air, conditions that are often present in ice rinks. During physical activity, individuals breathe through 
          their mouths, bypassing the nose's warming and humidifying functions.  “This allows cold, dry air to reach the lower airways and lungs 
          without passing through the nose, triggering asthma symptoms. Air pollutants, high pollen levels, and viral respiratory infections may 
          also be triggers” (American Academy of Asthma, Asthma, and Immunology, 2023).
          </p>

          <p>
          Despite having similar baseline lung function parameters to non-EIB individuals, figure skaters with EIB tend to exhibit a notable 
          decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) following exercise. This decline is evident 
          immediately after exercise and persists for several minutes, reflecting the transient nature of EIB symptoms.
          </p>

          <p>
          The incidence of EIB among figure skaters appears to be higher than that of the general population and other highly trained athletes, 
          with studies indicating rates of around 35%. This heightened susceptibility underscores the importance of screening for EIB and 
          implementing appropriate therapeutic interventions to manage symptoms and optimize both performance and respiratory health in figure skaters.
          </p>

          <p>
          Given the impact of EIB on the well-being and athletic performance of figure skaters, strategies to mitigate its effects should be prioritized. 
          These may include using pre-exercise bronchodilators, warming up thoroughly before engaging in strenuous activity, and minimizing exposure to 
          triggers such as cold air and airborne irritants. Additionally, ongoing monitoring and management of asthma symptoms are crucial for ensuring 
          the overall health and longevity of figure skaters' careers.
