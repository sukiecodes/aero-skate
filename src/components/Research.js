          <h3>Asthma as a result of Nitrogen Dioxide</h3>
          <p>
          “Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a toxic gas, a product of combustion in malfunctioning ice-resurfacing machines. 
          NO2 poisoning is rare but potentially lethal” (Bret et al., 2013). High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide 
          have been measured in arenas because of the combustion engine-powered machines that re-ice the floors and 
          keep the arena cold. Exposure to NO2 in ice arenas is associated with an increased prevalence of asthma symptoms 
          among athletes. 
          </p>

          <p>
          The toxic nature of NO2 contributes to its harmful effects on the respiratory system. NO2 easily penetrates the 
          peripheral airways and alveoli, where it reacts with water to form nitrous and nitric acid. These acids can increase 
          cell membrane permeability, leading to pulmonary edema and pneumonitis, exacerbating respiratory conditions like asthma.
          </p>

          <p>
          To mitigate the risks associated with NO2 exposure in ice arenas, various strategies have been proposed. One approach 
          is to replace combustion engine-powered ice-resurfacing machines with electrically powered ones, which produce lower 
          levels of NO2 emissions. Additionally, regular environmental assessments and service controls should be conducted to 
          ensure that NO2 levels are kept within safe limits.

          <h3>
            Typical Treatments for Asthma
          </h3>
          <p>
          Although asthma isn’t a condition that can be fixed, there are therapies to help with the symptoms. Most athletes 
          are prescribed drugs like Short-Acting Beta Agonists (SABAs). SABAs are inhaled medicines that help open airways. 
          It relaxes the bronchial smooth muscle, treating bronchospasm that is refractory to the epinephrine. SABAs are typically 
          taken 15-30 minutes before exercising. If the athlete doesn’t want to go the drug route, they can also supplement their 
          inhaler therapy with a few other options:
          </p>

          <h4>
          Heat and Moisture Face Masks
          </h4>
          <p>
          “Face masks worn during training and prior to competition are able to capture the heat and moisture in exhaled breath 
          and use it to warm and moisten the inhaled air as a defense against airway dehydration and subsequent narrowing”
          </p>

          <h4>
            Fish Oils
          </h4>
          <p>
          “Studies suggest that the use of omega-3 fish oils can reduce airway inflammation and provide a protective effect 
          against asthma associated with exercise.”
          </p>

          <h4>
            Prebiotics
          </h4>
          <p>
          “Recent evidence suggests that a dietary prebiotic supplement that targets the good bacteria in the gut can 
          reduce the severity of asthma in physically active asthma patients and reduce airway inflammation.”
